# Srv Dev Server

This is a simple HTTP Server for use in a development environment, inspired by [simple-http-server](https://github.com/TheWaWaR/simple-http-server) and [caddy2](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy), and it is also a practice project for me to learn rust.

```

##### Other Linux

Download the pre-compiled `srv-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz` on the [releases](https://github.com/Tim-Paik/srv/releases/latest), and copy the srv file in the compressed package to `/usr/bin` as a ROOT user with 755 permissions.

```shell
wget https://github.com/Tim-Paik/srv/releases/download/v1.0.1/srv-v1.0.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz
tar -xzvf srv-v1.0.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz

```
for reference only

#### MacOS

I'm sorry I don't have the corresponding equipment, but I can only provide `srv-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` (Of course, if someone can sponsor me a Mac I would be very grateful)

#### Windows

Download the pre-compiled `srv-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` in the [releases](https://github.com/Tim-Paik/srv/releases/latest), unzip the srv.exe and copy it to your `%PATH%` (if you donâ€™t know what this is, move `srv.exe` to `%SystemRoot%\System32`)

### Compile and Install

You Need:

 - Rust & Cargo Installation
 - Git Installation
 - Gcc/Msvc Toolchain Installation

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Tim-Paik/srv.git
cd srv
cargo build --release
```

Then you can find the compiled executable file named `srv` in the `target/release/` folder.
